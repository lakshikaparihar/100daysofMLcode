# Interactive Map

Several arguments customize the appearance of the map:

* `location` sets the initial center of the map. We use the latitude (42.32째 N) and longitude (-71.0589째 E) of the city of Boston.
* `tiles` changes the styling of the map; in this case, we choose the OpenStreetMap style. List of titles are [here](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium/tree/master/folium/templates/tiles)
* `zoom_start` sets the initial level of zoom of the map, where higher values zoom in closer to the map.

<br>


# Bubble Map

Note that `folium.Circle()` takes several arguments:

* `location` is a list containing the center of the circle, in latitude and longitude.
* `radius` sets the radius of the circle.
Note that in a traditional bubble map, the radius of each circle is allowed to vary. We can implement this by defining a function similar to the color_producer() function that is used to vary the color of each circle.
color sets the color of each circle.
* The `color_producer()` function is used to visualize the effect of the hour on robbery location.

# HeatMaps

As you can see in the code cell above, folium.plugins.HeatMap() takes a couple of arguments:

* `data` is a DataFrame containing the locations that we'd like to plot.
* `radius` controls the smoothness of the heatmap. Higher values make the heatmap look smoother (i.e., with fewer gaps).

Introduction
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create interactive maps with the folium package. Along the way, you'll apply your new skills to visualize Boston crime data.

import folium
from folium import Choropleth, Circle, Marker
from folium.plugins import HeatMap, MarkerCluster
Your first interactive map
We begin by creating a relatively simple map with folium.Map().

# Create a map
m_1 = folium.Map(location=[42.32,-71.0589], tiles='openstreetmap', zoom_start=10)

# Display the map

Several arguments customize the appearance of the map:

location sets the initial center of the map. We use the latitude (42.32째 N) and longitude (-71.0589째 E) of the city of Boston.
tiles changes the styling of the map; in this case, we choose the OpenStreetMap style. If you're curious, you can find the other options listed here.
zoom_start sets the initial level of zoom of the map, where higher values zoom in closer to the map.
Take the time now to explore by zooming in and out, or by dragging the map in different directions.

The data
Now, we'll add some crime data to the map!

We won't focus on the data loading step. Instead, you can imagine you are at a point where you already have the data in a pandas DataFrame crimes. The first five rows of the data are shown below.

# Load the data
crimes = pd.read_csv("../input/geospatial-learn-course-data/crimes-in-boston/crimes-in-boston/crime.csv", encoding='latin-1')

# Drop rows with missing locations
crimes.dropna(subset=['Lat', 'Long', 'DISTRICT'], inplace=True)

# Focus on major crimes in 2018
crimes = crimes[crimes.OFFENSE_CODE_GROUP.isin([
    'Larceny', 'Auto Theft', 'Robbery', 'Larceny From Motor Vehicle', 'Residential Burglary',
    'Simple Assault', 'Harassment', 'Ballistics', 'Aggravated Assault', 'Other Burglary', 
    'Arson', 'Commercial Burglary', 'HOME INVASION', 'Homicide', 'Criminal Harassment', 
    'Manslaughter'])]
crimes = crimes[crimes.YEAR>=2018]

# Print the first five rows of the table
crimes.head()

Plotting points
To reduce the amount of data we need to fit on the map, we'll (temporarily) confine our attention to daytime robberies.

daytime_robberies = crimes[((crimes.OFFENSE_CODE_GROUP == 'Robbery') & \
                            (crimes.HOUR.isin(range(9,18))))]
folium.Marker
We add markers to the map with folium.Marker(). Each marker below corresponds to a different robbery.

# Create a map
m_2 = folium.Map(location=[42.32,-71.0589], tiles='cartodbpositron', zoom_start=13)

# Add points to the map
for idx, row in daytime_robberies.iterrows():
    Marker([row['Lat'], row['Long']]).add_to(m_2)

# Display the map
m_2

folium.plugins.MarkerCluster
If we have a lot of markers to add, folium.plugins.MarkerCluster() can help to declutter the map. Each marker is added to a MarkerCluster object.

# Create the map
m_3 = folium.Map(location=[42.32,-71.0589], tiles='cartodbpositron', zoom_start=13)

# Add points to the map
mc = MarkerCluster()
for idx, row in daytime_robberies.iterrows():
    if not math.isnan(row['Long']) and not math.isnan(row['Lat']):
        mc.add_child(Marker([row['Lat'], row['Long']]))
m_3.add_child(mc)

# Display the map
m_3

Bubble maps
A bubble map uses circles instead of markers. By varying the size and color of each circle, we can also show the relationship between location and two other variables.

We create a bubble map by using folium.Circle() to iteratively add circles. In the code cell below, robberies that occurred in hours 9-12 are plotted in green, whereas robberies from hours 13-17 are plotted in red.

# Create a base map
m_4 = folium.Map(location=[42.32,-71.0589], tiles='cartodbpositron', zoom_start=13)

def color_producer(val):
    if val <= 12:
        return 'forestgreen'
    else:
        return 'darkred'

# Add a bubble map to the base map
for i in range(0,len(daytime_robberies)):
    Circle(
        location=[daytime_robberies.iloc[i]['Lat'], daytime_robberies.iloc[i]['Long']],
        radius=20,
        color=color_producer(daytime_robberies.iloc[i]['HOUR'])).add_to(m_4)

# Display the map
m_4

Note that folium.Circle() takes several arguments:

location is a list containing the center of the circle, in latitude and longitude.
radius sets the radius of the circle.
Note that in a traditional bubble map, the radius of each circle is allowed to vary. We can implement this by defining a function similar to the color_producer() function that is used to vary the color of each circle.
color sets the color of each circle.
The color_producer() function is used to visualize the effect of the hour on robbery location.
Heatmaps
To create a heatmap, we use folium.plugins.HeatMap(). This shows the density of crime in different areas of the city, where red areas have relatively more criminal incidents.

As we'd expect for a big city, most of the crime happens near the center.

# Create a base map
m_5 = folium.Map(location=[42.32,-71.0589], tiles='cartodbpositron', zoom_start=12)

# Add a heatmap to the base map
HeatMap(data=crimes[['Lat', 'Long']], radius=10).add_to(m_5)

# Display the map
m_5
Make this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -> Trust Notebook
As you can see in the code cell above, folium.plugins.HeatMap() takes a couple of arguments:

data is a DataFrame containing the locations that we'd like to plot.
radius controls the smoothness of the heatmap. Higher values make the heatmap look smoother (i.e., with fewer gaps).
Choropleth maps
To understand how crime varies by police district, we'll create a choropleth map.

As a first step, we create a GeoDataFrame where each district is assigned a different row, and the "geometry" column contains the geographical boundaries.

# GeoDataFrame with geographical boundaries of Boston police districts
districts_full = gpd.read_file('../input/geospatial-learn-course-data/Police_Districts/Police_Districts/Police_Districts.shp')
districts = districts_full[["DISTRICT", "geometry"]].set_index("DISTRICT")
districts.head()
geometry
DISTRICT	
A15	MULTIPOLYGON (((-71.07416 42.39051, -71.07415 ...
A7	MULTIPOLYGON (((-70.99644 42.39557, -70.99644 ...
A1	POLYGON ((-71.05200 42.36884, -71.05169 42.368...
C6	POLYGON ((-71.04406 42.35403, -71.04412 42.353...
D4	POLYGON ((-71.07416 42.35724, -71.07359 42.357...
We also create a Pandas Series called plot_dict that shows the number of crimes in each district.

# Number of crimes in each police district
plot_dict = crimes.DISTRICT.value_counts()
plot_dict.head()
D4     2885
B2     2231
A1     2130
C11    1899
B3     1421
Name: DISTRICT, dtype: int64
It's very important that plot_dict has the same index as districts - this is how the code knows how to match the geographical boundaries with appropriate colors.

Using the folium.Choropleth() class, we can create a choropleth map. If the map below does not render for you, try viewing the page in a different web browser.

# Create a base map
m_6 = folium.Map(location=[42.32,-71.0589], tiles='cartodbpositron', zoom_start=12)

# Add a choropleth map to the base map
Choropleth(geo_data=districts.__geo_interface__, 
           data=plot_dict, 
           key_on="feature.id", 
           fill_color='YlGnBu', 
           legend_name='Major criminal incidents (Jan-Aug 2018)'
          ).add_to(m_6)

# Display the map

Note that folium.Choropleth() takes several arguments:

* `geo_data` is a GeoJSON FeatureCollection containing the boundaries of each geographical area.So we will convert the districts GeoDataFrame to a GeoJSON FeatureCollection with the __geo_interface__ attribute.
* `data` is a Pandas Series containing the values that will be used to color-code each geographical area.
* `key_on` will always be set to feature.id.
* `fill_color` sets the color scale.
* `legend_name` labels the legend in the top right corner of the map.
