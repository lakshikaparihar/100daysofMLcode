[Kiva](https://www.kiva.org/) is an online crowdfunding platform extending financial services to poor people around the world. Kiva lenders have provided over $1 billion dollars in loans to over 2 million people.
Kiva reaches some of the most remote places in the world through their global network of "Field Partners". These partners are local organizations working in communities to vet borrowers, provide services, and administer loans.


In this exercise, we will investigate Kiva loans in the Philippines by identifying regions that might be outside of Kiva's current network, in order to identify opportunities for recruiting new Field Partners.
